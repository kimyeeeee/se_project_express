# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project will help users organize their closet at the click of a button. They can add pictures of items, like or dislike specific items, get a list of all their items, and it will even tell the user what to wear based on the weather!

Programs used are MongoDB and Postman. We set up a linter and used hot reload. In this sprint, we were able to apply our knowledge of setting up routes and contrllers. This is shown in both the users and clothing items. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
